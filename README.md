# 📊 Predicting Company Profits with Multiple Linear Regression  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project uses a **Multiple Linear Regression model** to predict company profits based on three key factors:  
- Productivity Expense  
- Management Expense  
- Promotions Expense  

## 🎯 Objective  
To analyze how different business expenses impact profits and build a model that helps in smarter decision-making.  

## 🛠️ Methodology  
- Data preprocessing and exploration  
- Applied Multiple Linear Regression  
- Evaluated model using:  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - R² Score  

## 📈 Results  
The model shows how strongly each expense contributes to profit and provides insights for better resource allocation.
